2. AVG Solar energy usage countries above 500
SELECT round(avg(usage)), country FROM solar GROUP BY country HAVING avg(usage) > 500 ORDER BY avg(usage) DESC;

3. Countries first collection 2012
SELECT min(year), country
FROM solar
GROUP BY country HAVING min(year) = 2012
ORDER BY country ASC;

4. Four columns - wind and solar usage for germany each year
SELECT solar.country, solar.year, wind.usage, solar.usage
FROM solar
JOIN wind ON solar.year = wind.year
WHERE solar.country = 'Germany' AND wind.country = 'Germany'
ORDER BY year ASC;

**IN CLASS**
SELECT solar.country, solar. year, wind.usage, solar.usage
FROM wind
JOIN solar ON solar.year = wind.year AND wind.country = solar.country
WHERE solar.country = 'Germany'
ORDER BY wind.year;

5. Avg Wind and solar usage for each country, order by average solar show top 10
SELECT wind.country, avg(wind.usage), avg(solar.usage)
FROM wind
JOIN solar ON wind.country = solar.country
GROUP BY wind.country
ORDER BY avg(solar.usage) DESC LIMIT 10;

6. Average wind and solar usage for each country from 2010, ORDER BY average solar usage and only show top 10
SELECT wind.country, avg(wind.usage), avg(solar.usage)
FROM wind
JOIN solar ON wind.country = solar.country
WHERE solar.year >= 2010 AND wind.year >= 2010
GROUP BY wind.country
ORDER BY avg(solar.usage) DESC LIMIT 10;

7. First year of data and most recent year for each country from solar. Limit to first 15 with the oldest year and then in alphabetical order.
SELECT country, min(year), max(year) 
FROM solar
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY min(year), country ASC LIMIT 15;

8. Subquery, join solar table twice, first to get usage from earliest date next to get usage from most recent date. Order it by the most usage from the most recent year.
WITH solar1 AS (SELECT country, min(year) AS first_year, max(year) AS last_year FROM solar GROUP BY country ORDER BY min(year), country ASC LIMIT 15)
SELECT solar1.country, solar1.first_year, solar1.last_year, solar.usage
FROM solar
JOIN solar1 ON solar.year = solar1.first_year AND solar.country = solar1.country
ORDER BY solar1.first_year, solar1.country ASC;


WITH solar1 AS (
    SELECT country, min(year) AS first_year, max(year) AS last_year 
    FROM solar 
    GROUP BY country 
    ORDER BY min(year), country ASC LIMIT 15),
    solar2 AS (

    FROM solar 
    GROUP BY country 
    ORDER BY min(year), country ASC LIMIT 15),

FROM solar
JOIN solar1 ON solar.year = solar1.last_year AND solar.country = solar1.country
JOIN solar2 ON solar.country = solar2.country
ORDER BY last_usage DESC;

9. Average other on average solar and wind
WITH energy1 AS (SELECT wind.country, avg(wind.usage) AS avg_wind, avg(solar.usage) AS avg_solar
FROM wind
JOIN solar ON wind.country = solar.country
GROUP BY wind.country)
SELECT energy1.country, avg(thermal.usage) AS avg_thermal, energy1.avg_wind, energy1.avg_solar
FROM energy1
JOIN thermal
ON energy1.country = thermal.country
GROUP BY energy1.country, energy1.avg_wind, energy1.avg_solar
ORDER BY avg(thermal.usage) DESC LIMIT 10;

# Hi, Jon! I don't understand why it wanted me to include 'avg_wind' and 'avg_solar' in the group by statement. I was getting an error message that said, 'column "energy1.avg_wind" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function'
